The goal of this file is to start the data preprocessing and cleaning process by addressing missing values and type inconsistencies. This will involve identifying any missing data and converting any inconsistent data types to ensure the data is ready for further analysis.
In this lesson we learn about, python packages, pandas and seaborn. We perform importing and exporting data and cleaning, visualizing and analyzing using these python libraries.
# clean dataset: automobiles.csv
#Project Goal: We want to estimate the prices of used cars. In order to achieve this goal, we learn about a usecase that requires data analysis, a dataset to be analyzed in python and overview of python packages for data analysis. We start by importing data, cleaning the data and performing statistical summary and analyzing our initial observation.
