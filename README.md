# CarAppraisalUsingPythonLibraries
The project is part of PCP DA - Programming Foundation and Data Analytics with Python certification by Simplilearncollaborated with  Purdue Online University and IBM
# refernece dataset: autos.csv
# Part 1 : CarAppraisalDataCleaning.ipynb 
The goal of this file is to start the data preprocessing and cleaning process by addressing missing values and type inconsistencies. This will involve identifying any missing data and converting any inconsistent data types to ensure the data is ready for further analysis.
In this lesson we learn about, python packages, pandas and seaborn. We perform importing and exporting data and cleaning, visualizing and analyzing using these python libraries.
# clean dataset: automobiles.csv
# Project Goal: We want to estimate the prices of used cars. In order to achieve this goal, we learn about a usecase that requires data analysis, a dataset to be analyzed in python and overview of python packages for data analysis. We start by importing data, cleaning the data and performing statistical summary and analyzing our initial observation.
# Part 2 : CarAppraisalDataWrangling.ipynb
Goal: Predict the price of the car based on other car features (predictors)
Project Goal: The goal of this file is to start the data wrangling process to ensure the data is ready for further analysis.
# Part 3 : CarAppraisalEDA.ipynb 
Project Goal: The goal of this file is to start exploratory data analysis process covering groupby, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Correlation.
The question to answer is "What are the main characteristics that have the most impact on the used car price?"
# Part 4 : CarAppraisalModelDev.ipynb 
In this section, we will develop several models that will predict the price of the car using the variables or features. This is just an estimate but should give us an objective idea of how much the car should cost. Some questions we want to ask in this module,
Do I know if the dealer is offering fair value for my trade-in? do I know if I put a fair value on my car? 
In Data Analytics, we often use Model Development to help us predict future observations from the data we have. A Model will help us understand the exact relationship between different variables and how these variables are used to predict the result.
# Conclusion : Comparing these three models, we conclude that the MLR model is the best model to be able to predict price from our dataset. This result makes sense, since we have 27 variables in total, and we know that more than one of those variables are potential predictors of the final car price.
